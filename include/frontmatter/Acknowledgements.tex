I want to thank my supervisor Martin Cederwall for the guidance during the work of this thesis. I am especially grateful for the many clarifications of intriguing features of these theories. I also want to thank Jakob Palmkvist who also have helped me get a better understanding of this field. Moreover, I would like to thank my fellow master's students Johannes Aspman and Adrian Padellaro for sharing their work with me as well as for many interesting discussions about theoretical physics in general. I am furthermore thankful to Johannes for feedback on the report.
