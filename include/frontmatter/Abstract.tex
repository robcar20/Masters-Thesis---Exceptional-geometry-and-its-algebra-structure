\section*{Abstract}
String theory/M-theory provide consistent theories of quantum gravity and their low-energy effective theories compactified on torii posses ``hidden'' symmetries given by the exceptional Lie groups. Extended geometries aims to make these symmetries manifest by enlargening the notion of geometry by extending spacetime to transform in certain modules of a extended structure group. In the exceptional case which are the main physical interest this unifies gravitational and non-gravitational degrees of freedom. This thesis presents an introduction to this field starting with motivation from supergravity/string theory; it then continues by introducing the formalism in two special cases, double field theory and exceptional field theory, before the general construction of extended geometries are introduced. A different approach of exceptional generalised geometry making the exceptional groups manifest in supergravity is also discussed. This is also used to study some details of flux compactifications rather naturally.
